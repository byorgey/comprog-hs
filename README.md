Competitive programming utilities in Haskell
--------------------------------------------

Code that I use for solving competitive programming problems in
Haskell.  See [Competitive Programming in Haskell: Basic
Setup](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2019/04/24/competitive-programming-in-haskell-basic-setup/)
for an introduction.  Individual files also link to blog posts where
they are discussed.
